# JavExtras

_Simple extensions to Java ("extras") without any added dependencies messing you up._

## MicroLibraries

### JavExtras is made up of many small "micro" libraries

- Small, single-feature libraries:
  - Have zero (or very few) depedencies
  - Don't change often and are thus stable to use
  - Have fewer breaking changes / releases
    - Meaning less upgrade work for you
  - Are easier to understand and maintain

The impact of this is that you can add JavExtras libs to your project without it becoming a maintenance headache.
Add only the features you like without worrying about future changes.
